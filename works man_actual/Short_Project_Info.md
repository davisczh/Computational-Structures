**Description**

Welcome to our arcade-style casual auto-scrolling survival game, where you take on the role of a vigilant guide to your player.

Your mission is to protect the player from perilous tree branches that descend with the tree while he relentlessly chops it down. The game challenges your reflexes and timing as you navigate the player left and right, dodging branches. The catch is due to the mist, you cannot see the branches too close to the ground and have to remember the order in order to dodge them successfully.

With each successful move, the tree gets closer to being chopped down, and your score increases. But beware, a single hit from a branch results in a game over.

Can you lead your player to safety and achieve a high score? Play now and find out!
